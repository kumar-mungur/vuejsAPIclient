## VueJS API Client Demo

### About

This is a VueJS demo API client project based that uses [Boostrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com).
The project makes use of [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for api calls to [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

The project is intended as a simple demonstration of using VueJS as a client application for REST based API CRUD.

This is by no means a production ready application.
